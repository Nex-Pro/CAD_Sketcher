The model subpackage defines a set of blender PropertyGroups . This is needed so that values are stored to disk on file save. These PropertyGroups have to be registered and then be pointed to from somewhere by a PointerProperty. Additionally to pure properties PropertyGroups can also hold methods and attributes, the addon makes heavy use of that as it leads to a convenient way of working with the data. The root of the addon's data structure is SketcherProps which is registered on blender's Scene type and can therefore be accessed as follows: bpy.context.scene.sketcher From there the structure looks as follows: sketcher - entities - points3D (CollectionProperty of 3D Points) - lines3D (CollectionProperty of 3D Lines) - sketches - ... constraints coincident (CollectionProperty of coincident constraints) equal ... Note: The nesting of PropertyGroups is done by defining PointerProperties inside of a PropertyGroup. Entities Entities always inherit from the SlvsGenericEntity class which implements the basic properties (like properties to store if an entity is visible, construction, origin etc.) and logic (like the draw method which draws itself based on its geometry batch) entities have. Index system As an entity can depend on other entities there has to be a way to point to an entity. This is done by storing an unique index on each entity (entity.slvs_index) which is set when an entity is created through its \"add_*\" method on the SlvsEntities class. Pointing to an entity is done by storing the entity's index in a IntProperty, the entity itself can then be looked up by: entity = bpy.context.scene.sketcher.entities.get(index) For convenience there's the slvs_entity_pointer function which registers the IntProperty with a \"_i\" prefix and adds getter/setter methods to directly get the entity without having to deal with the index itself. Drawing Entities are drawn in the viewport by utilizing blenders GPU Module . Every entity type has an update function which is responsible for creating the geometry batch that is used for drawing. As this can be expensive to compute the batches are stored based on the entity's index in global_data.batches. There's an initial tagging system in place to tag entities as dirty however this is currently still disabled by default. NOTE: In order to draw anything a draw handler has to be registered on the viewport type. This usually happens from an operator that the user invokes. As this is rather bad UX the addon registers the handler when the addon is registered. More precisely, as the the context at register time is limited, a Application Timer is used to register the draw handler shortly after the addon has been registered. Selection Entity selection is done by simply drawing entities a second time in an Offscreen Texture . The color however is used to identify the entity. The two functions index_to_rgb() and rgb_to_index() inside functions.py are used to convert between the entity's \"slvs_index\" and the color value that is written to the texture. This concept is explained here . NOTE: There's the \"Write Selection Texture\" operator in the debug panel which can be used to write the current selection texture to an image data-block in order to inspect it. Preselection The addon makes great use of preselection highlighting. To achieve that the VIEW3D_GT_slvs_preselection gizmo is used which looks up the currently hovered pixel and writes the index to global_data.hover whenever the \"test_select\" method is called. NOTE: The test_select method of gizmos is used as it receives the cursor location and is called whenever the cursor moves. Constraints Constraints always inherit from the GenericConstraint class which implements the basic properties (like properties to store if a constraint is visible or has failed to solve etc.) and some basic logic that constraints have. Unlike entities the constraints are not implemented completely from scratch but rather make use of the Gizmo API to display themselves and handle other interactions like selection. Interaction There's a set of operators defined in operators.py which are used to create the interaction between the user and the addon. Note that the addon also has to define operators for basic interactions like selection or calling the context menu due to the fact that entities are implemented from scratch. Most of the viewport operators inherit from the StatefulOperator class which is a framework to allow defining complex tools in a declarative fashion. Besides the base class itself which implements logic for native blender types there's also the GenericEntityOp which adds support for addon specific types. Have a look at the interaction chapter in the docs. The addon also makes heavy use of workspacetools. Note that they depend on some functionality defined in the StatefulOperator class to display the correct description and get the tools shortcuts. NOTE: Tools that need to be able to select entities have to use the preselection gizmo in order to get updated selection. Solver The addon uses the Python Binding of Solvespace . As the solver module isn't well documented it's best to inspect it through the an interactive python interpreter. This can be done inside blender's python console when the solver module has been installed, something like this: from py_slvs import slvs sys = slvs.System() On the system object you'll find all the methods to add entities and constraints. You can use the inspect module to get more info like the signature of a function: import inspect inspect.signature(sys.addEqual) The solver data isn't persistent, so whenever the solver is triggered it will create a new \"py_slvs.slvs.System\" object.Then the solver will go through the relevant entities and call their create_slvs_data method and pass the system object to it. Same applies to the constraints. The create_slvs_data has to return the solver handles of the elements it adds to the solver. This is later used to check which constraints have failed to solve. When the solver was successful it will again go through all the entities and call their update_from_slvs methods to update the blender data from the solver system. Converter Currently there is only one native converter implemented, namely the BezierConverter defined in converters.py. When converting to mesh the target bezier object is simply converted again with blenders to_mesh function. This is a design choice to workaround the problem of finding the area to fill for a given shape. As a bezier spline is defined by a list of bezier control-points entities we have to create a list of connected entities. This is done by the BezierConverter.walker() method. After that we cam simply loop through these connected entities and call their to_bezier() method. FAQ What happens when a button is pressed?

Active A constraint is considered to be active when the sketch it belongs to is set as the active sketch or, for constraints that don't belong to a sketch, when no sketch is active. Failure Whenever the solver fails to find a solution for the given system it will try to mark constraints that are causing the failure. Those constraints will be colored red, additionally the failed sketch will be marked. Types Constraint types follow the implementation of solvespace . Geometric Constraints SlvsCoincident Forces two points to be coincident, or a point to lie on a curve, or a point to lie on a plane. The point-coincident constraint is available in both 3d and projected versions. The 3d point-coincident constraint restricts three degrees of freedom; the projected version restricts only two. If two points are drawn in a workplane, and then constrained coincident in 3d, then an error will result\u2013they are already coincident in one dimension (the dimension normal to the plane), so the third constraint equation is redundant. SlvsVertical Forces a line segment to be vertical. It applies in 2D Space only because the meaning of horizontal or vertical is defined by the workplane. SlvsHorizontal Forces a line segment to be horizontal. It applies in 2D Space only because the meaning of horizontal or vertical is defined by the workplane. Note: It\u2019s good to use horizontal and vertical constraints whenever possible. These constraints are very simple to solve, and will not lead to convergence problems. Whenever possible, define the workplanes so that lines are horizontal and vertical within those workplanes. SlvsParallel Forces two lines to be parallel. Applies only in 2D. SlvsPerpendicular Forces two lines to be perpendicular, applies only in 2D. This constraint is equivalent to an angle constraint for ninety degrees. SlvsEqual Forces two lengths, or radiuses to be equal. If a line and an arc of a circle are selected, then the length of the line is forced equal to the length (not the radius) of the arc. SlvsTangent Forces two curves (arc/circle) or a curve and a line to be tangent. SlvsMidpoint Forces a point to lie on the midpoint of a line. SlvsRatio Defines the ratio between the lengths of two line segments. The order matters; the ratio is defined as length of entity1 : length of entity2. Dimensional Constraints SlvsDistance Sets the distance between a point and some other entity (point/line/Workplane). SlvsDiameter Sets the diameter of an arc or a circle.

They differ from regular blender mesh or curve elements which means native blender tools aren't able to interact with it as long as they aren't converted. See the chapter integration for further details on how to process addon specific geometry. Entities are defined by a set of parameters and pointers to other entities which are editable at any point in time. This allows non-destructive workflows and also ensures that geometry is resolution independent. A curve will always follow a given radius no matter how it's transformed. Entities can be created with the various Workspacetools . Active An entity is considered to be active when the sketch it belongs to is set as the active sketch or, for 3D entities, when no sketch is active. Visibility Entities can be hidden. Access the setting from the entity's context menu or from the entity browser . Construction Entities have a construction parameter which can be set via the entity's context menu . If it's set to true the entity will be ignored when converting the geometry however it's still used to solve the geometric system. It's generally good practice to mark entities as construction if they're not part of the final geometry. Fixed Entities can be fixed via the entity's context menu . A fixed entity won't have any degrees of freedom and therefor cannot be adjusted by the solver. It's good practice to base geometry on a fixed origin point. Warning: While this currently applies to all entities it's intended to be used with points only. Types There are different types of entities, some of them apply in 2 dimensional space which requires a sketch as a parameter. Entity types follow the implementation of solvespace . Only 2D entities can be converted later, check the chapter integration for details. SlvsPoint3D Representation of a point in 3D Space.

So in order to further process drawn shapes they have to be converted to a native type first. INFO: There are some limitations to keep in mind when converting. Convert Types When a sketch is active you can choose the convert type for it in the sidebar. By default this is set to None which means no native geometry will be created. INFO: Setting this to something other than None will disable the visibility of the sketch so that it will only show when it's active Bezier Converter Converts the sketch to a bezier curve. Mesh Converter Converts the sketch to a mesh. This doesn't convert to mesh directly but rather uses the bezier converter and the native to_mesh() function behind the scene. Fill Shape Some converters support the Fill Shape setting. When this isn't set the resulting geometry won't have surfaces at all but rather just edges. INFO: The setting toggles the bezier's fill_mode option between None and Front Limitations 3D Geometry Conversion requires a sketch, the addon currently doesn't support creating 3D sketches and is therefor limited to the conversion of 2D entities. Non-Persistent Geometry The output geometry will be re-generated each time a sketch is deactivated. Converters don't take any modifications that are done after the conversion into account. INFO: Indices of created geometry elements aren't persistent. Referencing such elements isn't currently supported. In order to further process geometry after the conversion make sure you do this in a procedural way, otherwise things might break when editing the sketch. Path Connections Converters parse the geometry depending on shared start-/endpoints, connections created with coincident constraints or overlaps between entities aren't interpreted as a connection. Precision Bezier curves cannot exactly represent a circle. Converted curves are only an approximation to an exact arc or circle. Converted meshes also suffer from that error since the mesh convert type is currently based on the bezier converter. Best Practices To avoid running into such limitations try to follow these practices: Connect entities by sharing a start-/endpoint, avoid using the coincident constraint to connect entities that are part of a path that you intend to later convert. Use the construction option whenever you create geometry that you don't intend to convert. If you have alot of construction geometry create a dedicated sketch that is used for construction only.

Addon tools usually work on one specific entity or between a few entities where the order of selection matters. As the existing system of selection isn't ideal in this context the addon defines a generic interaction system which allows for a powerful and flexible workflow. Stateful Operations Most tools in the addon are implemented as stateful tools. In this context a state represents one target like a selection or a value. When running a tool you will iterate through these states until all states have valid input. Let's take the \"Add Circle\" tool as an example. Since a circle is represented by its center and radius the tool will have two states. One to define the center element and one to set the radius. State Types A state can have two different kind of targets: Pointer A pointer target is best described as a selection. Pointer states will prompt the user to select an element of the according type. Property A property target simply represents a value of some kind like an integer or a float or a set of values to represent something like a location. A state can however define both of those targets. In that case the property will be used to create a new element to satisfy the pointer target. This is often used to be able to place a new point at the mouse location when nothing is hovered but pick an existing point if one is hovered. Selection vs Action To be as flexible as possible the interaction system allows to work in different paradigms which can also be freely mixed. Those are: Select -> Invoke Operation (The standard way to work in blender) Invoke Operation -> Select Partial Select -> Invoke Operation -> Select rest (Or set Parameters) Numerical Edit In order to precisely edit a states property, it's possible to edit values directly by entering numbers. When the stateproperty is a set of multiple values (e.g. XYZ Location) they will be treated as sub-states, meaning you can iterate (TAB) through them and enter values sequentially. Description When learning how a new tool works it's best to take a look at its tooltip, this will list the different states of the tool. For pointer states this will additionally display the accepted types that can be picked. While running an operation the statusbar will display that information for the currently active state. Immediate Execution Most tools support immediate execution which will invoke the tools operations when switching to it and a valid selection is given.

Gizmos Gizmos are used to display constraints. There are specific gizmo types for the three dimensional constraints, angle, distance and diameter. To interact with the settings of a constraint click its gizmo to open a menu. The rest of the constraints use a generic gizmo that is displayed next to the entities they depend on.
